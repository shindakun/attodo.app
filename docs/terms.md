These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Oregon, United States, without regard to conflict of law principles.

### Informal Resolution

Before filing a legal claim, please contact us to resolve the issue informally. We'll do our best to work it out.

### Arbitration

Any disputes will be resolved through binding arbitration in Portland, Oregon, rather than in court, except:
- Small claims court disputes
- Intellectual property disputes
- Privacy rights violations

### Class Action Waiver

You agree to resolve disputes individually, not as part of a class action or collective proceeding.

(Some jurisdictions don't allow arbitration or class action waivers, so these may not apply to you.)

### Entire Agreement

These Terms and our Privacy Policy constitute the entire agreement between you and AT Todo.

### Severability

If any provision is found unenforceable, the rest of the Terms remain in effect.

### No Waiver

Our failure to enforce any right doesn't waive that right.

### Assignment

You cannot transfer these Terms. We may assign them to a successor or affiliate.

We're not liable for delays or failures due to events beyond our reasonable control (natural disasters, pandemics, war, internet outages, etc.).
